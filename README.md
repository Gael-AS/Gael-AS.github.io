Gael Andrade-Serrano (gaelandrade27@gmail.com).
A new GitHub account that will be used for future assignments.
I created a clone of my first repository. 
I downloaded GitHub for desktop and clicked on the clone button, selected my repository that I made and then saved it to a GitHub folder in order for it to download.
